                  "SYMPLECTIC GEOMETRY is the ultimate generalization of Hamiltonian mechanics! The basic idea of Hamiltonian mechanics is to write down an expression (called Hamiltonian) for a conserved quantity (like energy) as depending on an unknown function p(t) (e.g. position), and one related to its first derivative q(t) (say, momentum). You then demand that the Hamiltonian is stationary, that it doesn't change, which is cleverly formalized by setting its derivative to zero, and solve for p!",

His work builds on 1989 work by Girard. I don't actually know if it was Altenkirch, Girard, or someone else who first proved strong normalization for System F. Anyway, the amazing thing about Altenkirch's proof is that it uses an even bigger calculus, the \"calculus of constructions\", in the form of an actual implementation called \"LEGO\"."

A domain theorist would now start looking for an object T such that T is isomorphic to the \"function space\" T -> T. But to obtain a satisfactory such T, one would not look in the category of sets and functions. One would end up using other categories, e.g. ones where the objects are certain kinds of topologies, and the morphisms continuous functions. Or even weirder categories. More generally, one would try to find a \"Cartesian Closed Category\", or something similar, where the "

A first aspect is with its being kin to euclidean models of non-euclidean geometries, and complementary if not above them in terms of \"manifesting the phenomenon\" despite not having benefited from as much historical attention. A second aspect is for how it may dispute or mellow the hegemony of axioms, in the context of interpreting Ockham's call for parsimony in terms of data compression and axiomatic systems (à la \"algorithmic information theory\"). These two aspects are likely not wholly independent, it's perhaps arguable that the post-euclidean revolution didn't dethrone axioms as much as it would have if projective duality had taken the stage at the same time as non-euclidean geometries and their euclidean models; and that this is reflected by the exaggerated emphasis on axioms in mathematized elaborations on Ockham's dictum."

My shorthand for Gödel's theorems is that trying to remove ambiguity from a(n extensive enough) system by making the relationships of terms mechanical, results in delocalized ambiguity that traverses the whole system. Coordinated re-interpretations of terms are possible that don't change the mechanical language of the definitions that bind them together. Projective duality is also a case of that."

Physicists will shrug at that, but for mathematicians this may get them all interested in the topoic in the first place, it now being precise and clear. More shocking of course would be if your code finds that there do appear further cocycles as one continues climbing up the brane bouquet. Who knows, there are various speculations that could be compatible with this (F-theory is among them, but also \"bosonic M-theory\" and other things). If your computer does find such a nontrivial cocycle, that'll be a huge deal.

Writing r(p/q) for the square root of the radius corresponding to the fraction p/q (written in its lowest terms), we have that 1/r(1/2) = 2/r(1), so r(1/2)=1/2 (taking r(1) to be 1). Then 1/r(1/3)=1/r(1)+1/r(1/2), so r(1/3)=1/3. We also get 1/r(2/5)=1/r(1/2)+1/r(1/3)=5, so r(2/5)=1/5. So it looks as though r(p/q)=1/q."

So it all works, provided each circle is labelled with a fraction whose denominator (in its lowest terms) is the sum of the denominators of the fractions associated with the two circles immediately above it.

A small thing but I wasted a fair amount of time on something that wasn't relevant to the discussion.

Also, I've written it the way I have because it looks like a product rule for differentiation. Namely, if we replace [W, blah] with blah' and all other brackets with multiplication, we get (XY)' = (X')Y + X(Y'). This ties in with the idea of Lie algebra elements as infinitesimals/derivatives."

There is also another direction which comes from the fact that the solution of the Hilbert 5th problem passes by something called Gleason metric, which is a distance explaining how 2-generated groups look like. What happens is that this is an Euclidean-like distance. On the other side, if you look at a finitely generated group (say sitting in your continuous group and generated by smaller and smaller elements, like exp( epsilon a) ... ) then the natural metric is not Gleason's but the Cayley metric, rescaled by a 1/epsilon. Then infinitesimally, as you pass with epsilon to 0, typically you don't get a Lie algebra structure, as is the case with the usual construction involving the Gleason metric. All this is fascinating but few people really know about, physicists being the most clueless, although I guess this could be very relevant for them.  "

Combinatorial quandle theory seems much harder than combinatorial group theory. Things like the word problem are really hard even for very simple-looking quandles. To my mind (and this is definitely debatable) the reason things are hard is that our notion of computability is based on Turing machines, lambda calculus, etc., which are \"natively\" associative because they're based on locally manipulating strings of symbols. Maybe there are other \"natural\" models of computation in which quandles aren't so hard. In particular, one thought I had in mind was probabilistic algorithms.such as simulated annealing. Are quandle words badly behaved with respect to such algorithms? I don't know whether anyone has looked at such questions, but my speculation would be no- I would speculate that quandles are \"not significantly harder than groups\" in some well-defined sense with respect to certain classes of probabilistic algorithms. But maybe I'm wrong."

                      "ok, lets talk about. first of all you self have to define your risk level for yourself when you are in \"trouble mode\". for me it is defined like follows: e1= my initial entry, this is were i open my position. i do not want to hedge, rather i want to have my position stopped out in gain by reaching my T1 = target one. If the position goes against me i can decide to close the position with a loss or to hedge. If you hedge you define another target = T2 and the math is  made not to loose = breakeven. The problem you mention is absolutely true = the bets rise significant, but if you reach one of your targets you are out of the game without a loss. I defined for myself entry + 7 hedges, from the 5 th hedge on, i go into my \"trouble mode\" because i know that i will loose a huge amount of money if the 7th hedge is not succesfull. In my trouble mode i wanna close nearly equal trades (some in gain and some in loss). In my view this is something very important because you take \"money from the table\" and reduce risk. Sometimes you had 5 hedges and after merger close you have not that much \"net exposure\". Merger close means that you do not have to pay commissions and you can save some money. You need trading skills to trade like this, understand the market and know the behaviour of the \"big boys\" who have to move the market as well as the personality of \"your\" market. I myself i am only daytrading the EUR/USD currency pair and use hedging as part of my daytrading. All the best and thanks for the effort "

A technical subject isn't usefully discussed by trying to guess at what it might mean, but by studying it. Of course it's true that Riemann's hypothesis remains to be proved.

It's useful to recall that Fermat's last theorem could be proved, only once people understood  what it implied for elliptic curves-and, even then, it wasn't by any means obvious, as the work of Wiles, Wiles and Taylor showed and the subsequent work of Taylor and collaborators on the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture (that's now a theorem)."

I'd argue for that by pointing out that if we consider the two ellipses that have as their semi-major and semi-minor axes (c and b) and (c and a) respectively, both of these will have foci along the c axis, since it is the longest principle axis and must therefore be the major axis for either ellipse. Their foci will lie at different points on the axis, however, since b > a. That means that each one is a focus only in the corresponding plane; rays from either point that travel in the perpendicular plane (e.g. a ray from an a-c focus travelling in the b-c plane) will not reach the opposite focus."

Is it just a coincidence that spin-1/2 particles are represented by four-components spinors (and spacetime is 4-d)? Can there be such a thing as a 6-component spin-1 spinor with three spin states and two energy states?"

At first i thought Turing machines were really perceived as simpler just because the machine-like character is more suggestive on how to build a computer. But somehow the part on how to build state engines in hardware was missing... And i also noted that many would like to talk about Church's \"machines\" instead."

The unfortunate thing is the the subject is built on top of commutative algebra, and certainly I would recommend learning a little bit of differential geometry first. It seems that you know a bit about commutative algebra already, so if you can get your hands on Robin Hartshorne's \"Algebraic Geometry\", it's an \"industry standard\".

Multiplication by a number (\"scalar\") or other theta variables does not autmatically give zero. Was a bit unsure how one gets mixed variables but i think staring at R^{p|q} and the superspace wikipedia page helped a bit. There's only two variables and they're not independent.

That was just one symbol. 12*δ^i_j would be a multiple of the identity matrix (in this case, a scaling transformation).

I think his connection (from your words) of the free will of particles to that of humans comes in that way (collapsing wavefunctions), if I am reading that correctly. Decoherence theory is likely more palatable in this regard but I have not done any reading there. And as I understand it, decoherence does not require humans. That makes much more sense to me. "

The properties of QM action at a distance are independent of humans - the EPR paradox simply maps a QM thing into the human version of things.
