I haven't watched this one yet, but I have little doubt that it is just as entertaining and accessible as the previous ones. Except maybe for last year's, which was recorded with a spherical camera, which is only fun if you have a player made for this kind of recording. But luckily, this year's was recorded with a normal camera again."

This led me to the Cobordism Hypothesis and now a general approach to open systems, where open systems of some particular sort are treated as morphisms in a category, and the \"behavior\" of open systems of this sort is described by a functor.  The basic idea here is called \"functorial semantics\" and was initiated by Lawvere in 1963.  After that it became important in the semantics of functional programming languages, but Atiyah introduced it in quantum physics, which gave it a whole new scope... and now I'm using it in electrical engineering, chemistry and the like.",

I always try to dig behind the scenes, so if I have a formula, I understand why it’s there. And understanding is a very difficult notion. People think mathematics begins when you write down a theorem followed by a proof. That’s not the beginning, that’s the end. For me the creative place in mathematics comes before you start to put things down on paper, before you try to write a formula. You picture various things, you turn them over in your mind. You’re trying to create, just as a musician is trying to create music, or a poet. There are no rules laid down. You have to do it your own way. But at the end, just as a composer has to put it down on paper, you have to write things down. But the most important stage is understanding. A proof by itself doesn’t give you understanding. You can have a long proof and no idea at the end of why it works. But to understand why it works, you have to have a kind of gut reaction to the thing. You’ve got to feel it.",

His contributions include his famous solution of the Grothendieck conjecture in anabelian geometry about hyperbolic curves over number fields. He initiated and developed several other fundamental developments: absolute anabelian geometry, mono-anabelian geometry, and combinatorial anabelian geometry. Among other theories, Mochizuki introduced and developed Hodge–Arakelov theory, p-adic Teichmüller theory, the theory of frobenioids, and the etale theta-function theory.",

Then two elements r and t of R are equal modulo S, that is, r + S = t + S iff r = t + s for some s in S. Now let's define multiplication by (r + S) x (t + S) = (r x t) + S. For this to be well defined, we need: if r1 + S = t1 + S and r2 + S = t2 +S, then r1 x r2 + S = t1 x t2 + S. From the assumption we get r1 = t1 + s1 and r2 = t1 + s2 for some s1, s2 in S. So we need that r1 x r2 = t1 x t2 + s for some s in S. But r1 x r2 = (t1 + s1) x (t2 + s2) = t1 x t2 + t1 x s2 + s1 x t2 + s1 x s2. While s1 x s2 is indeed in S, we have now guarantee that t1 x s2 and s1 x t2 are in S. But if S where an ideal, it would be closed against multiplication with "

Some decades before in my freshmen physics studies we had a course called simply 'algebra\". What we saw there was exactly that: structures build on sets by defining the appropriate type of operations and mapping (aka morphism), using it to partition the domain (the modding) and to define the canonical decomposition of that mapping. Of course each type of structures has its own particular properties worth studying but the way to talk about them was the same: start with sets and functions between them, where each function defines an equivalence relation induced by the equality of the images. This gives rise to a canonical projection from the domain onto the quotient set. The decomposition of the function through it follows  immediately. From this point on introduce internal binary operations on a set and proceed analogously. Here it seemed natural to talk about morphisms otherwise one loses all the extra information introduced by the internal operation. In this way we would build monoids, groups, rings, fields, and vectorial spaces. It was fun. "

Few mathematicians have the intelligence and foresight to create a new area of mathematics and Sol was one of them. His book “Polyominoes,” first published in 1965, codified an entire field of recreational mathematics and Sol invented the term “polyomino” in 1953. While a few problems involving polyominoes had appeared earlier, he was the one that made it a discipline. "

Polyominoes of any number of squares can be created, although the smaller structures are the most easy to work with. The number of polyominoes that can be created using n squares grows rapidly. There are 12 that can be made with 5 squares, 63,600 with 12 squares and approximately 7 x 10^31 with 56 squares. Therefore, the number of problems is effectively infinite. Sol’s series of papers that appeared in “Recreational Mathematics Magazine” in 1961-1963 are classic papers that introduced and expanded the field. "

Few mathematicians have the intelligence and foresight to create a new area of mathematics and Sol was one of them. His book “Polyominoes,” first published in 1965, codified an entire field of recreational mathematics and Sol invented the term “polyomino” in 1953. While a few problems involving polyominoes had appeared earlier, he was the one that made it a discipline. "

Polyominoes of any number of squares can be created, although the smaller structures are the most easy to work with. The number of polyominoes that can be created using n squares grows rapidly. There are 12 that can be made with 5 squares, 63,600 with 12 squares and approximately 7 x 10^31 with 56 squares. Therefore, the number of problems is effectively infinite. Sol’s series of papers that appeared in “Recreational Mathematics Magazine” in 1961-1963 are classic papers that introduced and expanded the field. "

In 1931, Austrian logician Kurt Godel shocked the worlds of mathematics and philosophy by establishing that such statements are far more than a quirky turn of language: he showed that there are mathematical truths which simply can't be proven. In the decades since, thinkers have taken the brilliant Godel's result in a variety of directions—linking it to limits of human comprehension and the quest to recreate human thinking on a computer. In this full program from the 2010 Festival, leading thinkers untangle Godel's discovery and examine the wider implications of his revolutionary finding.",

In 1931, Austrian logician Kurt Godel shocked the worlds of mathematics and philosophy by establishing that such statements are far more than a quirky turn of language: he showed that there are mathematical truths which simply can't be proven. In the decades since, thinkers have taken the brilliant Godel's result in a variety of directions—linking it to limits of human comprehension and the quest to recreate human thinking on a computer. In this full program from the 2010 Festival, leading thinkers untangle Godel's discovery and examine the wider implications of his revolutionary finding.",

The question is: can you live without searching for patterns, for structure, for some sort of 'logic' to it all, even knowing full well you will probably never find anything fascinating? Are you able to watch nature, hear about physics (say QM or GR) or other sciences, and just \"let it be\"? Or do you need to find out more, even just a little, or just be part of the process? I can understand both answers to this well enough - yes, curiosity killed the cat, and no, I do not know any compelling reason not to just let it all go and live a life dedicated to unbridled hedonism. But for some people, for some period of time, the scientific process may become part of almost-sensual pleasures... sometimes the tiny break-throughs, the instants you finally understand something that you had so far totally missed... it can almost make the other decades of your wasted life seem worthwhile. But sometimes, most times, it slips away, it's no pleasure anymore, just boring sisyphean drudgery, and that is when one has to wonder..."

(Algebraic topology aims to understand topological structures by associating algebraic objects to them.)"

The number of triangles meeting at each of the seven corners is 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3. These are exactly the entries of the second to top row of the frieze! The same idea can be used to match every frieze of width 4 with a triangulation of a heptagon, and vice versa. It follows from this result that the entries in any given row of a frieze of width n–3 must form a periodic cycle of length 7, and indeed this is the case for the frieze in the picture."

A quasicrystal in any given dimension is created by projecting a crystal – a periodic pattern – from a higher dimension to a lower one. For example, imagine projecting a 3-dimensional checkerboard – or cubic lattice made of equally spaced and sized cubes – onto a 2-dimensional plane at a certain angle. This 3D cubic lattice is a periodic pattern that may stretch out infinitely in all directions. The 2D, projected object is not a periodic pattern. Rather, it is distorted due to the angle of projection, and instead of containing only one shape that repeats infinitely like the 3D crystal does, it contains a finite number of different shapes (called proto-tiles) that are oriented relative to one another in specific ways, governed by a set of mathematical/geometrical rules, to fill the 2D plane in all directions. By analyzing the 2D projection it is possible, with the correct mathematical and trigonometric toolkit, to actually recover the “mother” object in 3D (the cubic lattice crystal in this example.) A famous example of a 2D quasicrystal is the Penrose tiling conceived by Roger Penrose in the 1970’s, in which a 2D quasicrystal is created by projecting a 5-dimensional cubic lattice to a 2D plane.\""

At the time, it was already known how to think about the way a 1-dimensional curve bends. Given a point P on the curve, one works as follows: you find the circle which best approximates the curve in a neighborhood of this point (the \"osculating circle\" at P), and then assign a value to the curvature of 1/R, where R is the radius of the osculating circle. This way, places where a curve look a lot like a straight line will get small values of curvature (because the radius R is big) and places where a curve bends pretty hard will get bigger values of curvature (because the radius R is smaller)."

Each one of these planes is then perpendicular to the surface at P. Where such a plane cuts the surface, we get a curve through P called a \"normal slice.\" Euler restricts attention to these special normal slice curves. (Well, he does more in the paper, but this is enough to state the big theorem.) For each normal slice, one can compute the curvature of that curve at P by the method above. Because it is good to keep track of this detail, we give curvature a positive sign if to get from P to the center of the osculating circle one travels in the direction N, and we give curvature a negative sign if one has to go in the direction of -N."

At the time, it was already known how to think about the way a 1-dimensional curve bends. Given a point P on the curve, one works as follows: you find the circle which best approximates the curve in a neighborhood of this point (the \"osculating circle\" at P), and then assign a value to the curvature of 1/R, where R is the radius of the osculating circle. This way, places where a curve look a lot like a straight line will get small values of curvature (because the radius R is big) and places where a curve bends pretty hard will get bigger values of curvature (because the radius R is smaller)."

Each one of these planes is then perpendicular to the surface at P. Where such a plane cuts the surface, we get a curve through P called a \"normal slice.\" Euler restricts attention to these special normal slice curves. (Well, he does more in the paper, but this is enough to state the big theorem.) For each normal slice, one can compute the curvature of that curve at P by the method above. Because it is good to keep track of this detail, we give curvature a positive sign if to get from P to the center of the osculating circle one travels in the direction N, and we give curvature a negative sign if one has to go in the direction of -N."

It does not close to become a proof that I can articulate, but that does not mean that it is not worth pursuing. There are many instances of mathematics that need to be pursued and have a fascination for some that are not yet complete. The reason Spencer-Brown's Laws of Form is paid small attention by most mathematicians has to do with other issues than his claims of proof. Laws of Form is about how mathematics is the consequence of imagining what a distinction would be if there could be a distinction. If this way of putting it disturbs you , then I am doing my job. We usually assume that some field of distinctions is given (numbers, a formal language, sets, limits, infinities, ...). If you start by asking what a distinction might be, you go into the lovely swamp of what comes before articulation, what may be there before language takes place. This is premathematical and prelogical and fraught with all the dangers that lie in wait on the other side of any boundary, however imaginary. Then by the time Spencer-Brown's calculus of indications arrives it has come forward as a formalism that, in its first interpretation, talks about what it does. There is one symbol, the mark, a right angle bracket, that can be seen to make a distinction between inside and outside in a plane. The reference of this calculus is to itself and in that way to the act of distinguishing. The act of distinguishing can not be separated from the 'one who distinguishes'. English fails and succeeds here in making a reference to that imaginary one who is sometimes called 'the observer' by cyberneticists. Spencer-Brown's Laws of Form actually begins with a maxim that occurs at the end of the book:"

One needs to specify inductive definitions for all the entities so they are not tied down to what can be (physically) written. There is an unconscious reflex that occurs, due to our training, that makes us suspicious of purely formal or diagrammatic definitions that leave out incantations of mathematical induction to certify the infinity of forms so constructed. But ... all our mathematics is supposed to be based on formal systems, and when you specify these you must do so inductively as well. On what is this first induction based? Topos theorists will not mind. The topos contains a natual numbers object and one does not worry about the base formal system, or does one?"

I mean, for the gaussian curvature, it is quite easy as you can see with the sign of the eigenvalues of the second fundamental form whether the curvature will be positive, negative or zero (whether you have a bump, a saddle point, or if one of the principal curvature is zero and hence, flat in at least one direction). But for the mean curvature, since it is the sum of the principal curvatures, one may just be more negative than the other one is positive, and this will make a negative mean curvature etc. How can I visually tell if a surface has zero mean curvature, or positive, or negative  ?"

It is not about the usefulness of the concept, as I am well-versed in complex analysis and appreciate the usefulness of the field; it is, for me, a matter of conceptual efficiency, being careful to represent arrays as arrays and single values as single values. You may claim I am prejudiced by my experience encoding concepts in software; perhaps, but I don't think so. The fact is that it requires two scalar variables to specify a complex \"number\"; and that is that, there is no other way."

Had they not artificially limited their compass to an imaginary plane surface (which, on a side-note, is itself an untoward idealization, since real surfaces of real objects always close back on themselves and are certainly not flat), and rather permitted their compass to circle around volumetrically like a tethered ball, they could have easily proven by construction that six equilateral triangles fit around a point -- and the history of mathematics would look a mite bit different I suspect. ;)"

I recognize that I have nobody to blame but myself for the persistence of this notion! During my three-year stint at NASA/ERC/Cambridge (1967-1970), I occasionally wrote progress reports and patent applications that disingenuously misrepresented the real reasons for my hunt for the gyroid and other triply-periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS): simple curiosity. I had already concluded in the summer of 1966 that an embedded minimal surface with the symmetry of the gyroid probably exists, but I wasn’t thinking about engineering applications, and it didn’t occur to me that atoms or molecules would ever ‘self assemble’ to define physical gyroids or other TPMS, even though I had seen a hint of just such a possibility in a 1965 article about the prolamellar body by Gunning and Jagoe. In 1967, after I had the stupendous good luck to be offered a cushy job at NASA/ERC by the physicist Lester C. Van Atta, I asked him what I would be expected to do there, and he answered simply, “Follow your nose”.  (Bits and pieces of what happened next can be found on my not-yet-organized webpage, ",

I have the impression that these days it is much more difficult than it was 40 or 50 years ago to obtain funding for research motivated by mere curiosity. Henry Margenau, my physics teacher at Yale in 1943, told us that Louis de Broglie’s original reasons for proposing wave-like properties for the electron were rooted in what appear to have been arm-waving kinds of symmetry arguments. The reasons I was convinced that the gyroid exists were also symmetry-based: its skeletal graph (the Laves graph) is the only example I could find, aside from the diamond and simple cubic graphs, of a self-dual triply-periodic cubic graph, and I found it difficult to imagine that Nature would fail to exploit it as the backbone of a TPMS the way She does the other two self-dual cubic graphs.",

I have the impression that these days it is much more difficult than it was 40 or 50 years ago to obtain funding for research motivated by mere curiosity. Henry Margenau, my physics teacher at Yale in 1943, told us that Louis de Broglie’s original reasons for proposing wave-like properties for the electron were rooted in what appear to have been arm-waving kinds of symmetry arguments. The reasons I was convinced that the gyroid exists were also symmetry-based: its skeletal graph (the Laves graph) is the only example I could find, aside from the diamond and simple cubic graphs, of a self-dual triply-periodic cubic graph, and I found it difficult to imagine that Nature would fail to exploit it as the backbone of a TPMS the way She does the other two self-dual cubic graphs.",

It required the discovery and exploration of a new field of mathematical ideas, far wider and more consequential than the Fermat Theorem itself. It is likely that any proof of the Riemann Hypothesis will likewise lead to a deeper understanding of many diverse areas of mathematics and perhaps of physics too. Riemann's zeta-function, and other zeta-functions similar to it, appear ubiquitously in number theory, in the theory of dynamical systems, in geometry, in function theory, and in physics. The zeta-function stands at a junction where paths lead in many directions. A proof of the hypothesis will illuminate all the connections. Like every serious student of pure mathematics, when I was young I had dreams of proving the Riemann Hypothesis. I had some vague ideas that I thought might lead to a proof.

Twelve years ago, my Princeton colleague Andrew Wiles polished off Fermat's Last Theorem, and only the Riemann Hypothesis remains. Wiles' proof of the Fermat Theorem was not just a technical stunt. It required the discovery and exploration of a new field of mathematical ideas, far wider and more consequential than the Fermat Theorem itself. It is likely that any proof of the Riemann Hypothesis will likewise lead to a deeper understanding of many diverse areas of mathematics and perhaps of physics too. Riemann's zeta-function, and other zeta-functions similar to it, appear ubiquitously in number theory, in the theory of dynamical systems, in geometry, in function theory, and in physics. The zeta-function stands at a junction where paths lead in many directions. A proof of the hypothesis will illuminate all the connections. Like every serious student of pure mathematics, when I was young I had dreams of proving the Riemann Hypothesis. I had some vague ideas that I thought might lead to a proof. In recent years, after the discovery of quasi-crystals, my ideas became a little less vague. I offer them here for the consideration of any young mathematician who has ambitions to win a Fields Medal.\""

One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i. e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e. g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs."
